## FAQ

### Q: What time does the snapshot get created?
**A:** Every trading day at 9:30 AM IST. This captures the opening market momentum.

### Q: Can I trade based on snapshot data after 9:30 AM?
**A:** The snapshot shows opening momentum. For later trades, use the **Live Monitor** for real-time data.

### Q: Why do some stocks show in watchlist instead of qualifying?
**A:** Watchlist stocks meet the price criteria (≥1%) but haven't met the OI threshold (≥10%) yet. They're worth monitoring.

**A:** Live data refreshes every 30 seconds during market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST).

### Q: What happens on market holidays?
**A:** The system recognizes NSE holidays. A banner will show "Market Closed" with the next opening date.

### Q: Can I export the qualifying stocks list?
**A:** Export feature is coming soon! For now, use the stock detail pages to analyze individual stocks.

**A:** Rising OI + Falling Price = Bearish sentiment (short buildup). This can indicate further downside or a potential short squeeze.

### Q: What's the difference between Dashboard and Live Monitor?
**A:** 
- **Dashboard**: Shows frozen 9:30 AM snapshot (best for planning)
- **Live Monitor**: Shows real-time data (best for monitoring)

### Q: Can I set alerts for specific price levels?
