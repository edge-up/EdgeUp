## Core Concepts

### What EdgeUp Measures

EdgeUp identifies **institutional money flow** by combining three critical factors:

1. **Price Movement** ≥1%
2. **Open Interest (OI) Change** ≥10%
3. **Breakout/Breakdown** confirmation

### Why This Works

- **Institutions** move markets, retail follows
- **Rising OI + Price Move** = Strong conviction
- **Early morning data** captures fresh positioning before retail crowd

---

## The EdgeUp Methodology

### The 9:30 AM Snapshot

**Why 9:30 AM is Critical**:
- First 15 minutes (9:15-9:30 AM) show true opening momentum
- Institutional orders placed overnight get executed
- Fresh money flow before day traders enter
- Sets the tone for the entire session

### Three-Factor Confirmation

#### Factor 1: Price Movement (≥1%)

**What it means**:
- Strong enough move to attract attention
- Filters out noise
- Shows directional conviction

**How to use**:
- ≥1%: Worth watching
- ≥2%: Strong momentum
- ≥3%: Very strong (but also higher risk)

#### Factor 2: OI Change (≥10%)

**What it means**:
- New positions being built (≥10% increase)
- Strong institutional interest
- Not just intraday scalping

**How to use**:
- 10-20%: Good conviction
- 20-30%: Strong conviction
- >30%: Very strong (verify it's not an outlier)

**Key Insight**: Price + OI together tell the full story:

| Price | OI | Interpretation |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| ↑ | ↑ | **Long Buildup** (Bullish) |
| ↓ | ↓ | **Long Unwinding** (Bearish) |
| ↓ | ↑ | **Short Buildup** (Bearish) |
| ↑ | ↓ | **Short Covering** (Bullish Rally) |

#### Factor 3: Breakout/Breakdown

**What it means**:
- Breaking 52-week high/low OR
- Significant technical level breach
- Momentum likely to continue

**How to use**:
- Confirms price move isn't just noise
- Higher probability of follow-through
- Attracts more buyers/sellers

## Entry Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Momentum Continuation

**Best for**: Trending markets

**Setup**:
1. Check 9:30 AM snapshot
2. Find stock with ALL three factors
3. Wait for 9:30-10:00 AM price action

**Entry Rules**:
- **For Longs**: Enter if price holds above 9:30 AM level
- **For Shorts**: Enter if price holds below 9:30 AM level
- **Confirmation**: Volume should remain strong

**Example**:
```
Stock: TCS
9:30 AM Snapshot:
- LTP: ₹3,420
- Change: +1.5%
- OI Change: +12%
- Direction: UP

Entry: If price stays above ₹3,420 by 10:00 AM
Target: ₹3,480 (next resistance)
Stop Loss: ₹3,390 (below opening low)
```

### Strategy 2: The Sector Rotation Play

**Best for**: When multiple stocks in same sector qualify

**Setup**:
1. Sector shows ≥3 qualifying stocks
2. Pick the strongest stock (highest % change + OI change)
3. Or pick the laggard (catching up potential)

**Entry Rules**:
- **Leader**: Enter the strongest for momentum
- **Laggard**: Enter weaker stocks expecting catch-up

**Example**:
```
Sector: NIFTY IT (Qualifying)
Stocks:
1. TCS: +2.1%, OI +15% (LEADER)
2. INFY: +1.8%, OI +12%
3. WIPRO: +1.2%, OI +11% (LAGGARD)

Strategy:
- Aggressive: Trade TCS (highest momentum)
- Conservative: Trade INFY (middle ground)
- Catch-up: Trade WIPRO (expecting to follow)
```

### Strategy 3: The OI Surge Play

**Best for**: Strong trending days

**Setup**:
1. Stock shows >20% OI increase
2. Price moving in same direction
3. Volume confirmation

**Entry Rules**:
- Enter on pullbacks (for longs) or rallies (for shorts)
- Look for 5-10 minute consolidation
- Enter when breakout resumes

**Risk**: Higher risk, higher reward strategy

### Strategy 4: The Contrarian Short Squeeze

**Best for**: Experienced traders only

**Setup**:
1. Stock falls but OI increases significantly (short buildup)
2. Price holds key support
3. Reversal candle forms

**Entry Rules**:
- Wait for reversal confirmation
- Enter when price breaks above recent high
- Quick scalp opportunity (shorts covering)

**Warning**: High risk - shorts can be right too!

## Exit Strategies

### Exit Rule 1: Time-Based

**The 2-Hour Rule**:
- Most momentum fades by 11:30 AM
- Exit 50% position by 11:00 AM
- Exit remaining by 12:30 PM

**Why**: 
- Morning momentum rarely sustains full day
- Afternoon can be choppy
- Lock in profits early

### Exit Rule 2: Target-Based

**Calculate Targets**:
```
Entry: ₹100
Average Move: 2% (from historical data)
Target 1: ₹102 (2%)
Target 2: ₹103 (3%)

Exit Plan:
- 50% at Target 1
- 30% at Target 2
- 20% trailing stop
```

### Exit Rule 3: Signal Reversal

**Exit Immediately If**:
- OI starts declining (position unwinding)
- Volume dries up (interest fading)
- Price breaks entry-day low (for longs)
- Opposite sector strengthens

### Exit Rule 4: Stop Loss

**Never Trade Without Stops**:
```
Entry: ₹100
Stop Loss: ₹98 (2% risk)
Position Size: Adjust so 2% of capital is max loss

Example:
Capital: ₹1,00,000
Max Loss per Trade: ₹2,000
Risk per Share: ₹2
Position Size: 1,000 shares
```

---

## Risk Management

### The 2% Rule

Never risk more than 2% of capital on any single trade.

```
Capital: ₹5,00,000
Max Risk: ₹10,000 per trade

If stop loss is ₹5 per share:
Max Shares = ₹10,000 / ₹5 = 2,000 shares
```

### Position Sizing

**Conservative** (1-2 setups/day):
- 2% risk per trade
- Max 3 positions at a time
- Total exposure: 6% of capital at risk

**Moderate** (2-4 setups/day):
- 1.5% risk per trade
- Max 4 positions
- Total exposure: 6% of capital at risk

**Aggressive** (4+ setups/day):
- 1% risk per trade
- Max 5 positions
- Total exposure: 5% of capital at risk

### Correlation Risk

**Don't trade multiple stocks from same sector**:
- If NIFTY IT is your pick, trade only 1-2 IT stocks
- Sector moves correlate - same risk, no diversification
- Better to spread across 2-3 different sectors

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Technique 1: The Stacking Effect

**When multiple sectors align**:
```
Bullish Sectors: 5
Bearish Sectors: 1

Market Bias: Strong Bullish
Strategy: Focus on longs only
Risk: Reduce position size (market can reverse)
```

### Technique 2: Historical Pattern Matching

**Use History tab**:
1. Find today's qualifying sectors
2. Check historical data for same sectors
3. See how they performed on similar days
4. Adjust expectations accordingly

**Example**:
```
Today: NIFTY BANK +1.5%, 4 qualifying stocks
History: Last 3 times this happened:
- Day 1: Continued +1.2%
- Day 2: Reversed -0.8%
- Day 3: Continued +2.1%

Insight: 66% success rate for continuation
```

### Technique 3: The Divergence Play

**When price and OI diverge**:

```
Price: +1.5%
OI: -5% (declining)

Interpretation: 
- Price move might be short covering
- Not backed by fresh longs
- Likely to reverse

Action: Avoid longs, watch for short opportunity
```

### Technique 4: Watchlist Stocks

**Stocks in watchlist (price ≥1%, OI <10%)**:
- Not fully qualified yet
- Watch for OI to increase
- Early entry opportunity if OI crosses 10%
- More risk but better risk:reward

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Ignoring OI
**Wrong**: "Stock is up 2%, I'll buy"
**Right**: "Stock is up 2% BUT OI is down 5%, I'll pass"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Trading After 11 AM
**Wrong**: Entering fresh positions at 1 PM
**Right**: Best entries are 9:30-10:30 AM

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Stop Loss
**Wrong**: "I'll exit if it falls more"
**Right**: Stop loss set BEFORE entering trade

### ❌ Mistake 4: Overtrading
**Wrong**: Trading every qualifying stock
**Right**: Pick 2-3 best setups with conviction

### ❌ Mistake 5: Revenge Trading
**Wrong**: Doubling position after loss to recover
**Right**: Taking a break, reviewing what went wrong

### ❌ Mistake 6: Ignoring Market Context
**Wrong**: Trading contra to overall market
**Right**: If market is weak, reduce position size even with good signal
